# Major StoryCanvas Update! 🚀

This is the biggest update the platform has ever received!

We've revamped the interface to be much more user-friendly. Now you can easily find the tiles that take you to the section you want. Additionally, you can contact the StoryCanvas team to request help or send a suggestion.

### **Books** 📚

The new book section now showcases your created books in a more organized way, with improved counters to show detailed information about each one.

- **Book Editing**
  The book editing interface has been redesigned for a cleaner experience. The book download section now makes it even clearer to see the chapters available for download.

  The chapter correction feature is more visible, so you can use it more quickly and efficiently.

  - **Notes** 📝
    Notes can now be edited directly without filling out a form like when you first create them.

  - **Characters** 👤
    Character information is displayed more cleanly, and you can now easily add or change a character's photo. The name generation tool is now directly available in the view.

  - **Places** 🏞️
    The view of places has been improved, and the images attached to the locations are now displayed in a larger view.

  - **Covers** 🎨
    Covers have a more refined view where you can make changes more quickly. The AI image generation tool is now more accessible for faster use.

**Most Important Book Editing Updates**

We've added three new tools that we hope will be very helpful when creating your books:

- **Task Board** 📋
  This tool allows you to create tasks to track your progress, such as events or to-dos, helping you maintain a better work structure.

- **Mind Maps** 🧠
  Mind maps allow you to organize the structure of your book. Create visual organizations for your characters, plot, or other elements. Make the most out of it!

  You can also download an image of your mind map and share it with whoever you like.
