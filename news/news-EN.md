# Update and Bug Fixes 🚀

We have made some updates to improve your experience on **StoryCanvas**.

## Main Changes

- A change was added to prevent the page from automatically translating with Google Translate. This caused an error that erased texts in the chapters section and prevented writing. ⚠️

### Note:
If you still experience this issue, we suggest taking the following steps:

- 🔄 **Reload the page** to get the update.
- 🚫 **Prevent your browser’s translation tool from automatically translating the page.**
